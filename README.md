# Hardware Synthesis and Optimization (HSO)

In this repository, you can find some algorithms written in Python
for lecture [[23619] Hardware Synthesis and Optimization](https://www.itiv.kit.edu/english/60_1095.php)
held by [Prof. JÃ¼rgen Becker](https://www.itiv.kit.edu/english/21_53.php)
from [Institute for Information Processing Technologies (ITIV)](https://www.itiv.kit.edu/english/index.php)
at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://www.kit.edu/english/).

I used them mainly to understand the algorithms myself and did not put too much effort in optimization and documentation.

Feel free to use and contribute!
